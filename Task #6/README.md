Spam Filter
Email filtering is the processing of email to organize it according to specified criteria. The term can apply to the intervention of human intelligence, but most
often refers to the automatic processing of messages at an SMTP server, possibly applying anti-spam techniques. Filtering can be applied to incoming
emails as well as to outgoing ones.

Depending on the calling environment, email filtering software can reject an item at the initial SMTP connection stage[1] or pass it through unchanged for
delivery to the user's mailbox. It is also possible to redirect the message for delivery elsewhere, quarantine it for further checking,modify it or 'tag'
it in any other way.

The upsurge in the volume of unwanted emails called spam has created an intense need for the development of more dependable and robust 
antispam filters. Machine learning methods of recent are being used to successfully detect and filter spam emails. We present a systematic review of some of the
popular machine learning based email spam filtering approaches. Our review covers survey of the important concepts, attempts, efficiency, and the research trend
in spam filtering. The preliminary discussion in the study background examines the applications of machine learning techniques to the email spam filtering process
of the leading internet service providers (ISPs) like Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook emails spam filters. 
Discussion on general email spam filtering process, and the various efforts by different researchers in combating spam through the use machine learning techniques 
was done. Our review compares the strengths and drawbacks of existing machine learning approaches and the open research problems in spam filtering.
We recommended deep leaning and deep adversarial learning as the future techniques that can effectively handle the menace of spam emails.
